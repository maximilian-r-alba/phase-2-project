# Good Eats

Inspired by nostalgia of Alton Brown and a personal desire to improve meal planning efforts, this project is meant to help create reference meal plans by accessing the Spoonacular API (https://spoonacular.com/food-api/). 

Through Spoonacular, users can search a database of over 5,000 recipes and save these recipes to a personal cookbook. Once saved, each recipe has its own recipe page which includes ingredients, serving size, macros per serving, and instructions provided by the API.[^1] This application then allows for the creation of a simple workweek meal plan that tracks the intake of the major macros; protein, carbs, fats, and calories. 


[^1]Note unfortunately some recipes in the API are unstandardized in their formatting or otherwise incomplete. These cases are not currently accounted for in this application.
